    <p>
Can you give me some examples of how you're consistent?

Sir, I'm consistently not going to gym. Consistently, uh,

sleeping for 12 hours. Consistently not taking shower.

What more do you want? Sir,

I meant examples of positive traits where you're consistent,

not negative traits. Sir,

these are positive traits.

Because I'm not taking shower.

I'm saving water.

Because I am sleeping 12 hours is very good for my body.

And because I'm not going to gym,

other people who are coming in the gym

are able to successfully do the exercise.

Because when I go to the gym,

I sleep on the bench press.

This all sounds like just an excuse for your inconsistency.

Sir, this is all a question of perception.

You think I'm different, and I think the world is different.
