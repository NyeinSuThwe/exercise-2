    <h1>Bro Has A Lot of Positive Traits</h1>
    <h3>@ucanhope</h3>
    <p>
      "Can you give me some examples of how you're consistent?" <br><br>
      <em>Sir</em>, I'm consistently not going to gym. <br>
      Consistently, uh, sleeping for 12 hours. <br>
      Consistently not taking shower. <br><br>
      What more do you want? <em>Sir?</em> <br><br>
      I meant examples of positive traits where you're consistent, <br>
      not negative traits. <br><br>
      These are <em>positive traits</em>. <br><br>
      Because I'm not taking shower, I'm saving water. <br>
      Because I am sleeping 12 hours, it is very good for my body. <br>
      And because I'm not going to gym, <br>
      other people who are coming in the gym <br>
      are able to successfully do the exercise. <br><br>
      Because when I go to the gym, I sleep on the bench press. <br><br>
      This all sounds like just an excuse for your inconsistency. <br><br>
      <em>Sir</em>, this is all a <em>question of perception</em>. <br>
      You think I'm different, and I think the world is different.
